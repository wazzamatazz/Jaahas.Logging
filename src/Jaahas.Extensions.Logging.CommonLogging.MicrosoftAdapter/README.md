# Jaahas.Extensions.Logging.CommonLogging.MicrosoftAdapter

[Common.Logging](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging) adapter that logs to [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/master/src/Logging).

This allows you to wire up logging from libraries that use `Common.Logging` to e.g. ASP.NET Core applications.
